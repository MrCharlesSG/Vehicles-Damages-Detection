# Vehicles Damages Detection

For more details see the [pdf report](https://github.com/MrCharlesSG/Vehicles-Damages-Detection/blob/main/Project.pdf).

The project was part of the subject of Computer Vision in the Software Engineering master's program at Algebra University College (Zagreb). The aim of the project was to explore different architectures and understandings in the field of Computer Vision, specifically focusing on a semantic segmentation problem to detect damages in vehicles. The project involved several key components:

- **Dataset**: The dataset was obtained from Roboflow and consisted of annotated images showing various types of vehicle damage.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: The models were evaluated using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and intersection over union (IoU).
- **State-of-the-Art Architectures**: The project explored several advanced architectures for semantic segmentation, including:
  - FCN-ResNet50
  - DeepLabV3-ResNet50
  - U-NET
  - SegNet
- **Custom Models**: Custom models were created and fine-tuned using PyTorch to improve accuracy in damage detection.
- **Additional Knowledge**: The project defence also required a general understanding of other Computer Vision problems, such as object detection and object classification, with a special focus on the YOLO (You Only Look Once) architecture.

The project and its defence were graded with a score of 92 out of 100.
